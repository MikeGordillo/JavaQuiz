# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz
​
## Your Task
​
As you proceed in your journey to becoming a full-stack web developer, it’s likely that you’ll be asked to complete a coding assessment, perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment is a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. 
​
To help you become familiar with these tests and give you a chance to apply the skills from this module, this week’s homework invites you to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. This week’s coursework will teach you all the skills you need to succeed in this assignment.

​I Struggled to get all the working parts of this assignment
I have learned a lot and hope to be able to do a re submission.
I am only missing very few pieces of the puzzle and would love to work on it further.
There are two html pages some css styles ans javascrit as asked.
I wanted to build something attractive as well as interactive.
Lots of moving parts and interaction.
I completed seven of the required tasks.
