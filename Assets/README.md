# Insights

I was really unhappy with my first submission.
I was too distracted with the looks of the app
and couldn't quite get the html and javascript together.
This is my second try at the quiz App.
I simplified the look and it helped to understand the working parts better.
The Quiz is timed and Stores the high scores in local storage.
This time around I met all the criteria.
This was a really challenging task for me.
